Feature: Searching timeseries fields
     As a user of JsApi
     I want to get the searching fields

     Background:
          Given an apikey user by "require-real-apikey"
     #TESTS WITH MOCK, ONLY TIMESERIES URIS: Given with mock "timeseries" for "filterFields"

     Scenario: Creating an organization to use in timeseries tests
          Given an ogapi "organizations builder" util
          Then I want to create an "organization"
          And the "name" "timeserie_organization"
          And the "description" "timeserie organization"
          And the "country code" "ES"
          And the "lang code" "es"
          And the "time zone" "Europe/Andorra"
          And the "zoom" 10
          And the "location" with 1 and 1
          Then I delete it
          Then I create it
          And response code should be: 201

     Scenario: Execute searching over assignable timeseries

          And the "timeBucket" 86400

Feature: Searching timeseriess data
  As a user of JsApi
  I want to search into timeseriess data collection
  So I can add filter, sorting, limit to search any timeseries, and delete it

  Background:
    Given an apikey user by "require-real-apikey"
  #TESTS WITH MOCK, ONLY TIMESERIES URIS: Given with mock "timeseries" for "searching"

  Scenario: Creating an organization to use in timeseries tests
    Given an ogapi "organizations builder" util
    Then I want to create an "organization"
    And the "name" "timeserie_organization"
    And the "description" "timeserie organization"
    And the "country code" "ES"
    And the "lang code" "es"
    And the "time zone" "Europe/Andorra"
    And the "zoom" 10
    And the "location" with 1 and 1
    # Then I delete it
    Then I create it
    And response code should be: 201

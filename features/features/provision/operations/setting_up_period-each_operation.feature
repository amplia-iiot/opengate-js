Feature: Setting up period with each pattern to operations
As a user of JsApi
I want to execute an FACTORY_RESET_TEST operation with a specific each pattern period configuration
So that I can execute FACTORY_RESET_TEST to some devices/subscriptions/subscribers/communications module with an each pattern period

    Background:

    Scenario: Precondition - Creating an organization to use in create device
        Given an ogapi "organizations builder" util
        Then I want to create an "organization"

        And I get allowed Datastreams fields
        And I can found "provision.device.identifier" as datastream name
        When I try to define the entity with...
